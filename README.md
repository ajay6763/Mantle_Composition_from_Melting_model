# PUM_Composition

Python script to calculate the distribution of major oxides into solid and melt phases due to
decompressional melting as a function of oceanic crust thickness or in other words aggregate percentage of frational melting. Distribution coefficients for major oxides are taken from Langmuir et al.,1992 and is based on Afons et al., 2008.
